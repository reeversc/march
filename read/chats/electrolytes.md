electrolytes
ChatGPT said:
Electrolytes are minerals that dissolve in bodily fluids to create electrically charged ions, helping regulate essential functions like hydration, nerve signaling, muscle contractions, and pH balance. The main electrolytes in the body include:

Sodium (Na⁺) – Regulates fluid balance and blood pressure.
Potassium (K⁺) – Essential for muscle contractions, heart function, and nerve signals.
Calcium (Ca²⁺) – Important for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission.
Magnesium (Mg²⁺) – Supports muscle relaxation, nerve function, and enzyme reactions.
Chloride (Cl⁻) – Helps maintain fluid balance and stomach acid production.
Phosphate (PO₄³⁻) – Important for energy production and bone health.
Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) – Helps regulate pH balance in the blood.
Electrolytes are lost through sweat, urine, and other bodily fluids, so they need to be replenished through diet or electrolyte-rich drinks. Common sources include fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and sports drinks. An imbalance—either too much or too little—can lead to dehydration, muscle weakness, irregular heartbeats, or even serious medical conditions.
