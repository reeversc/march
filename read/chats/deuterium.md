de-(something) water...what am i thinking of?
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you might be thinking of "deionized water" or "distilled water."

Deionized water: Water that has had most of its mineral ions removed, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, and chloride, typically using ion-exchange processes.
Distilled water: Water that has been purified through distillation, where it is boiled into vapor and then condensed back into liquid, removing impurities and minerals.
Let me know if that matches!

Here are a few more possibilities for "de-(something) water":

Desalinated water: Water from which salt and other minerals have been removed, often used to produce fresh drinking water from seawater.
Dehydrated water: While technically not water anymore, this phrase is sometimes used humorously or in reference to water removal during freeze-drying processes.
Dechlorinated water: Water that has had chlorine removed, often for use in aquariums or specific industrial processes.
Demineralized water: Similar to deionized water, this refers to water that has had most of its dissolved salts and minerals removed through processes like reverse osmosis or distillation.
Debubbled water: Water that has been treated to remove air bubbles, sometimes used in scientific or technical applications.
Any of these sound familiar?

Got it! Here are even more ideas:

Deoxygenated water: Water that has had dissolved oxygen removed, often used in chemical processes or scientific experiments.
Desaturated water: Water that has had excess dissolved gases or solutes removed.
Denatured water: This isn't a common term, but could refer to water used in industrial contexts with altered properties.
Depurated water: Water that has been purified or cleaned, often used in medical or technical contexts.
Does one of these resonate, or can you describe the context a bit more?

Here are even more possibilities for "de-(something) water":

Deionized water: Water with ions removed, used in labs and manufacturing.
Decontaminated water: Water cleaned of harmful contaminants or pathogens.
Desiccated water: This could refer to completely dried water-related products, though technically, water itself can't be "desiccated."
Decarbonated water: Water with dissolved carbon dioxide removed, often in soda or sparkling water processing.
Deuterium-depleted water (DDW): Water with a reduced level of deuterium, a heavy hydrogen isotope, often used in specialized medical or research applications.
Defluoridated water: Water that has had fluoride removed, often for health or environmental reasons.
Dewatered: This refers to the process of removing water from materials, such as in construction or wastewater treatment.
Any of these closer to what you're thinking of?

Ah, you’re thinking of deuterium-depleted water (DDW)! It’s a specialized type of water where the amount of deuterium (a heavier isotope of hydrogen) is reduced compared to natural levels. DDW is sometimes used in medical research, as there are studies investigating its potential effects on cellular processes and health.

Glad we figured it out! Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into DDW.
