suspensory ligament of the penis
ChatGPT said:
The suspensory ligament of the penis is a structure that helps support and anchor the penis to the pubic symphysis, ensuring stability during erection. Hereâ€™s an overview of its anatomy and function:

Anatomy
Location: The ligament originates from the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis and attaches to the deep fascia of the penis (Buck's fascia).
Structure: It is a dense, fibrous band of connective tissue.
Connections: It blends with the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa at the base of the penis.
Function
Support: Provides support to the penis, especially when erect, by stabilizing its base.
Anchor: Anchors the penis to the pubic bone, preventing excessive movement.
Assistance in Erection: Helps maintain the upward angle of the penis during an erection by tethering it to the pelvis.
Clinical Significance
Injury: Trauma to the suspensory ligament can cause instability or a loss of proper penile support, potentially affecting erectile function.
Surgery: In certain cosmetic procedures (e.g., penile lengthening), the suspensory ligament may be surgically divided. However, this can compromise the angle of erection and lead to other complications.
