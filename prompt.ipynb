        "  Creators are one of our central focuses. On Instagram, we continue to prioritize original posts in\n",
        "  recommendations to help smaller creators get discovered. We also want to ensure creators have a\n",
        "  place to experiment with their content, so we introduced a new feature in Q4 that allows creators\n",
        "  to first share a Reel with people who don’t follow them. This allows them to test content and see\n",
        "  what performs best before deciding to share it with their followers, and also helps introduce them\n",

        "  Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.\n",
        "  The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.\n",
        "  We continue to grow supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video, while optimizing ad supply\n",

        "  which we are beginning to test ads on this quarter. We expect the introduction of ads on Threads\n",
        "  will be gradual and don’t anticipate it being a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue\n",
        "  growth in 2025.\n",
        "  The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance.\n",
        "  6\n",
        "  The ongoing enhancements to our ads ranking systems are an important driver of this work.\n",
        "  In the second half of 2024, we introduced an innovative new machine learning system in\n",
        "  partnership with Nvidia, called Andromeda. This more efficient system enabled a 10,000x increase\n",
        "  in the complexity of models we use for ads retrieval, which is the part of the ranking process where\n",
        "  we narrow down a pool of tens of millions of ads to the few thousand we consider showing\n",

        "  models to better personalize which ads we show someone. This has driven an 8% increase in the\n",
        "  quality of ads that people see on objectives we’ve tested. Andromeda’s ability to efficiently\n",
        "  process larger volumes of ads also positions us well for the future as advertisers use our\n",
        "  generative AI tools to create and test more ads.\n",
        "  Another way we’re delivering value for advertisers is through increased automation of their ad\n",
        "  campaigns with Advantage+.\n",
        "  Adoption of Advantage+ shopping campaigns continues to scale, with revenue surpassing a $20\n",
        "  billion annual run-rate and growing 70% year-over-year in Q4. Given the strong performance and\n",

        "  more advertisers in the coming months before fully rolling it out later in the year.\n",
        "  Advantage+ creative is another area where we’re seeing momentum. More than 4 million\n",
        "  advertisers are now using at least one of our generative AI ad creative tools, up from one million\n",

        "  Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains\n",
        "  investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities.\n",
        "  On the first, we expect compute will be central to many of the opportunities we’re pursuing as we\n",

        "  across our platform, and fuel core ads and organic engagement initiatives.\n",
        "  We’re working to meet the growing capacity needs for these services by both scaling our\n",
        "  infrastructure footprint and increasing the efficiency of our workloads. Another way we’re\n",
        "  pursuing efficiencies is by extending the useful lives of our servers and associated networking\n",
        "  equipment. Our expectation going forward is that we’ll be able to use both our non-AI and AI\n",
        "  servers for a longer period of time before replacing them, which we estimate will be approximately\n",
        "  five and a half years. This will deliver savings in annual capex and resulting depreciation expense,\n",
        "  which is already included in our guidance.\n",
        "  Finally, we’re pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA silicon in areas where we\n",

        "  to pretrain a model, and that model is sort of agnostic to how many people are\n",
        "  using it.\n",
        "  Like at some level, it’s going to be expensive for us to serve all of these people\n",
        "  because we are serving a lot of people. And so I’m not sure what the kind of net\n",
        "  effect of all of this is. The field continues to move quickly. There’s a lot to learn\n",
        "  from releases from basically everyone who does something interesting, not just\n",
        "  the ones over the last month.\n",
        "  We’ll continue to kind of incorporate that into what we do as well as making\n",
        "  novel contributions to the field ourselves. And I continue to think that investing\n",
        "  very heavily in CapEx and infra is going to be a strategic advantage over time.\n",
        "  It’s possible that we’ll learn otherwise at some point, but I just think it’s way too\n",
        "  early to call that. And at this point, I would bet that the ability to build out that\n",
        "  kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage for both the quality of\n",
        "  the service and being able to serve the scale that we want to.\n",
        "  Susan Li: I’m happy to add a little more color about our 2025 CapEx plans to your second\n",
        "  question.\n",
        "  So we certainly expect that 2025 CapEx is going to grow across all three of\n",
        "  those components you described. Servers will be the biggest growth driver,\n",
        "  that remains the largest portion of our overall CapEx budget.\n",
        "  We expect both growth in AI capacity as we support our gen AI efforts and\n",
        "  continue to invest meaningfully in core AI, but we are also expecting growth in\n",
        "  15\n",
        "  non-AI capacity as we invest in the core business including to support a higher\n",
        "  base of engagement and to refresh our existing servers.\n",
        "  On the data center side, we’re anticipating higher data center spend in 2025 to\n",
        "  be driven by build-outs of our large training clusters and our higher power\n",
        "  density data centers that are entering the core construction phase. We’re\n",
        "  expecting to use that capacity primarily for core AI and non-AI use cases.\n",
        "  On the networking side, we expect networking spend to grow in ‘25 as we build\n",
        "  higher-capacity networks to accommodate the growth in non-AI and core AIrelated traffic along with our large Gen AI training clusters.\n",
        "  We’re also investing in fiber to handle future cross-region training traffic. And\n",
        "  then in terms of the breakdown for core versus Gen AI use cases, we’re\n",
        "  expecting total infrastructure spend within each of Gen AI, non-AI and core AI\n",
        "  to increase in ‘25 with the majority of our CapEx directed to our core business\n",
        "  with some caveat that that is -- that’s not easy to measure perfectly as the\n",
        "  data centers we’re building can support AI or non-AI workloads and the GPUbased servers we procure for gen AI can be repurposed for core AI use cases\n",
        "  and so on and so forth.\n",
        "  But overall, I would reiterate what Mark said. We are committed to building\n",
        "  leading foundation models and applications. We expect that we’re going to\n",
        "  make big investments to support our training and inference objectives, and we\n",

        "  on the use cases and how that could expand. Video is clearly a benefit. Local,\n",
        "  Marketplace, Groups have all been positive.\n",
        "  So any insights on the OG Facebook? And then back to Meta AI, given the\n",

        "  evolved to? What are people doing with Meta AI? Thank you.\n",
        "  Mark Zuckerberg: Okay. So for Facebook. A lot of people use Facebook every day, and it’s an\n",
        "  important part of their lives. And I think that there are a lot of opportunities to\n",
        "  make it way more culturally influential than it is today. And I think that that’s\n",
        "  sort of a fun and interesting goal that will take our product development in\n",
        "  some interesting directions that we maybe haven’t had a focus on it as much\n",
        "  over the last several years.\n",
        "  So I don’t know that I have anything much more specific on this other than that\n",

        "  investment area and something I’m going to spend some time on.\n",
        "  16\n",
        "  It might mean that in the near term, we make some trade-offs to kind of focus\n",
        "  on some product areas of what we’re doing ahead of just kind of maximizing\n",
        "  business results in the near term on it.\n",
        "  But overall, I’m really excited about doing some exciting stuff here. And I’m not\n",
        "  going to get into many specifics now but we’ll get -- we’ll follow up on this over\n",
        "  the next, I don’t know call it, half year or a year as we start rolling stuff out and I\n",
        "  think some of this will kind of get back to how Facebook was originally used\n",
        "  back in the day. So I think it will be fun.\n",
        "  Susan Li: I’m happy to share a little bit more about Meta AI and what people are doing\n",
        "  with it. We are in a phase where we are really learning a lot from the way that\n",
        "  people engage with Meta AI.\n",
        "  So from an app perspective, WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI\n",
        "  usage across our Family of Apps. People there are using it most frequently for\n",
        "  information seeking and educational queries along with emotional support use\n",
        "  cases. Most of the WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one threads, though we\n",
        "  see some usage in group messaging.\n",
        "  And on Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement,\n",
        "  we’re seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration that lets\n",
        "  people ask Meta AI questions about the content that is recommended to them.\n",
        "  So across, I would say, all query types, we continue to see signs that Meta AI is\n",
        "  helping people leverage our apps for new use cases.\n",
        "  We talked about information gathering, social interaction and communication.\n",
        "  Lots of people use it for humor and casual conversation. They use it for writing\n",
        "  and editing, research, recommendations. And as we look forward to 2025 in\n",
        "  our Meta AI roadmap, we are really focused on doing more to make it feel more\n",
        "  personalized.\n",
        "  So I would say some of the most exciting features we’re working on including\n",
        "  improving sort of the memory dimension of the Meta AI experience, where it\n",
        "  will be able to remember certain details that people share in one-on-one chats,\n",
        "  for example, and use those details to personalize its responses and then really\n",
        "  increasing its ability to deliver great content recommendations and enhance\n",
        "  really what makes Facebook and Instagram so valuable for people today.\n",
        "  Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\n",
        "  Please go ahead.\n",
        "  Kenneth Gawrelski: Thank you very much. Two for me, please. First, could you talk a little bit -- I\n",
        "  know you talked a little bit on the capital intensity side and the recent\n",
        "  developments, and it’s hard to see, it’s hard to tell yet where things are going.\n",
        "  But maybe you could just talk a little bit more near term, ‘25, the CapEx budget\n",
        "  you laid out or the CapEx forecast. Could you talk a little bit about the\n",
        "  17\n",
        "  constraints you’re seeing or where you’re seeing constraints, either internally\n",
        "  resources planning or externally and any one -- any parts of the ecosystem?\n",
        "  And then on the second one, I’m curious, as you think about the -- as you think\n",
        "  about your needs for hiring and we just think about -- we know you gave the\n",
        "  OpEx guide for this year.\n",
        "  But as we think about future needs for hiring, could you just give us a sense of\n",
        "  how we should think about that? You announced the performance-related\n",
        "  reductions earlier this -- for early this year. Could you just talk about how we\n",
        "  should be thinking about that ‘26, ‘27 and beyond? Thank you.\n",
        "  Susan Li: Sure. I’m happy to take both of those. So on your first question on just where\n",
        "  do we see constraints in our ability to execute against our CapEx plans,\n",
        "  obviously we are staying on top of supply availability. That is certainly one of\n",
        "  the factors that will influence our CapEx spend in 2025, but we don’t really\n",
        "  have any updates to share on supply availability right now.\n",
        "  We are planning to significantly ramp up deployment of GPUs in 2025, and\n",
        "  we’ll continue to engage with our vendors and invest in our own silicon to meet\n",
        "  those needs.\n",
        "  When you asked how to think about capital intensity, we’re not really -- as both\n",
        "  Mark and I alluded to in our prior comments, I think it is really too early to\n",
        "  determine what long-run capital intensity is going to look like. There are so\n",
        "  many different factors.\n",
        "  The pace of advancement in underlying models, how efficient can they be,\n",
        "  what is the adoption and use case of our Gen AI products, what performance\n",
        "  gains come from next-generation hardware innovations, both our own and\n",
        "  third party and then ultimately, what monetization or other efficiency gains our\n",
        "  AI investments unlock.\n",
        "  So again, I think we are -- we’re sort of early in the journey here, and we don’t\n",
        "  have -- I would say we don’t have kind of anything to share about long-run\n",
        "  capital intensity yet. Your second question was about thinking about hiring\n",
        "  needs.\n",
        "  So it’s a good segue after infrastructure, employee compensation is the next\n",
        "  largest driver of expense growth in 2025. And here, growth in employee comp\n",
        "  and headcount more broadly is primarily driven by those areas that I\n",
        "  mentioned, infrastructure monetization, generative AI, Reality Labs, and\n",
        "  regulation and compliance.\n",
        "  And those generally are more technical organizations. That means that it is a\n",
        "  higher cost base relative to business functions where we are also expecting to\n",
        "  keep headcount growth constrained. And I would say we are -- we’re focused\n",
        "  on running the company efficiently.\n",
        "  18\n",
        "  But at the same time it is -- we feel like we’re in a critical period in terms of\n",
        "  making sure that we are investing to win, and we want to make sure that we\n",
        "  staff those priority areas in a way that really positions us to best do that.\n",
        "  Kenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question.\n",
        "  Operator: And that question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go\n",
        "  ahead.\n",
        "  Ross Sandler: Yeah. One for Mark, on agents. So we all saw OpenAI’s operator demo last\n",
        "  week. So Mark, as the industry moves from chat to agentic behavior and more\n",
        "  commercial intent moves into these AI products, I guess how are you thinking\n",
        "  about monetization potential for Meta AI? And then how might Llama 4\n",
        "  reasoning help drive some of these new agentic experiences for Meta AI?\n",
        "  Thank you.\n",
        "  Mark Zuckerberg: Yeah. So I guess a couple of things that I’d say on this. One is when you’re\n",
        "  thinking about agents and reasoning, a lot of this is about being able to perform\n",
        "  multistep tasks. So right now the way that a lot of these systems work is you\n",
        "  kind of say something and then it responds and it’s almost chat like.\n",
        "  But I think that the direction that it’s going is you’re going to be able to give it\n",
        "  an intent or a task and it’s going to be able to go off and use sort of an arbitrary\n",
        "  amount of compute as much as you want to use on it to be able to do a task.\n",
        "  Some of the tasks might be pretty simple for people, go buy a specific thing.\n",
        "  Some of them might be really hard, like go write an app or optimize this code\n",
        "  and like really make it as good as possible. And that type of thing, I think, is just\n",
        "  going to start becoming more and more prevalent over the next year or two. So\n",
        "  I think it’s very exciting.\n",
        "  It sort of will feel in some ways like the current products are just getting\n",
        "  smarter and others, it will feel like sort of a new form factor because it won’t be\n",
        "  as much like chat. But it’s sort of another generation of these products.\n",
        "  So I think it’s just in general, there’s a lot to build and be excited about. I guess\n",
        "  my note of caution or just my kind of periodic reminder on our product\n",
        "  development process, if you will, is we build these products.\n",
        "  We try to scale them to reach usually a billion people or more. And it’s at that\n",
        "  point once they’re at scale that we really start focusing on monetization. So\n",
        "  sometimes we’ll experiment with monetization before, we’re running some\n",
        "  experiments with Threads now for example.\n",
        "  But we typically don’t really ramp these things up or see them as meaningfully\n",
        "  contributing to the business until we reach quite a big scale. So the thing that I\n",
        "  think is going to be meaningful this year is the kind of getting of the AI products\n",
        "  to scale.\n",
        "  19\n",
        "  Last year was sort of the introduction and starting to get it to be used. This\n",
        "  year my kind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale and\n",
        "  have sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it and improvement from that\n",
        "  that this will have a durable advantage.\n",
        "  But that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be a major contributor to the business\n",
        "  this year. This year, the improvements to the business are going to be taking\n",
        "  the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and\n",
        "  feeds and things like that.\n",
        "  So the actual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI Studio and business\n",
        "  agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of ‘25 for the\n",
        "  most part. And I think that’s an important thing for us to communicate and for\n",
        "  people to internalize as you’re thinking about our prospects here.\n",
        "  But nonetheless, we’ve run a process like this many times. We built a product.\n",
        "  We make it good. We scale it to be large. We build out the business around it.\n",
        "  That’s what we do. I’m very optimistic. But it’s going to take some time.\n",

        "  ahead.\n",
        "  Ross Sandler: Yeah. One for Mark, on agents. So we all saw OpenAI’s operator demo last\n",
        "  week. So Mark, as the industry moves from chat to agentic behavior and more\n",
        "  commercial intent moves into these AI products, I guess how are you thinking\n",
        "  about monetization potential for Meta AI? And then how might Llama 4\n",
        "  reasoning help drive some of these new agentic experiences for Meta AI?\n",
        "  Thank you.\n",
        "  Mark Zuckerberg: Yeah. So I guess a couple of things that I’d say on this. One is when you’re\n",
        "  thinking about agents and reasoning, a lot of this is about being able to perform\n",
        "  multistep tasks. So right now the way that a lot of these systems work is you\n",
        "  kind of say something and then it responds and it’s almost chat like.\n",
        "  But I think that the direction that it’s going is you’re going to be able to give it\n",
        "  an intent or a task and it’s going to be able to go off and use sort of an arbitrary\n",
        "  amount of compute as much as you want to use on it to be able to do a task.\n",
        "  Some of the tasks might be pretty simple for people, go buy a specific thing.\n",
        "  Some of them might be really hard, like go write an app or optimize this code\n",
        "  and like really make it as good as possible. And that type of thing, I think, is just\n",
        "  going to start becoming more and more prevalent over the next year or two. So\n",
        "  I think it’s very exciting.\n",
        "  It sort of will feel in some ways like the current products are just getting\n",
        "  smarter and others, it will feel like sort of a new form factor because it won’t be\n",
        "  as much like chat. But it’s sort of another generation of these products.\n",
        "  So I think it’s just in general, there’s a lot to build and be excited about. I guess\n",
        "  my note of caution or just my kind of periodic reminder on our product\n",
        "  development process, if you will, is we build these products.\n",
        "  We try to scale them to reach usually a billion people or more. And it’s at that\n",
        "  point once they’re at scale that we really start focusing on monetization. So\n",
        "  sometimes we’ll experiment with monetization before, we’re running some\n",
        "  experiments with Threads now for example.\n",
        "  But we typically don’t really ramp these things up or see them as meaningfully\n",
        "  contributing to the business until we reach quite a big scale. So the thing that I\n",
        "  think is going to be meaningful this year is the kind of getting of the AI products\n",
        "  to scale.\n",
        "  19\n",
        "  Last year was sort of the introduction and starting to get it to be used. This\n",
        "  year my kind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale and\n",
        "  have sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it and improvement from that\n",
        "  that this will have a durable advantage.\n",
        "  But that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be a major contributor to the business\n",
        "  this year. This year, the improvements to the business are going to be taking\n",
        "  the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and\n",
        "  feeds and things like that.\n",
        "  So the actual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI Studio and business\n",
        "  agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of ‘25 for the\n",
        "  most part. And I think that’s an important thing for us to communicate and for\n",
        "  people to internalize as you’re thinking about our prospects here.\n",
        "  But nonetheless, we’ve run a process like this many times. We built a product.\n",
        "  We make it good. We scale it to be large. We build out the business around it.\n",
