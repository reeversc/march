circadian 
ChatGPT said:
Circadian refers to biological processes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, responding primarily to light and darkness in an organism's environment. These rhythms are driven by an internal circadian clock and regulate various physiological functions, such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, body temperature, and metabolism.

Key Aspects of Circadian Rhythms:
Sleep-Wake Cycle – The most well-known circadian rhythm, influencing when we feel alert or sleepy.
Hormonal Regulation – Hormones like melatonin (promotes sleep) and cortisol (promotes alertness) are controlled by circadian rhythms.
Metabolism & Digestion – Circadian rhythms influence when the body is most efficient at digesting food and using energy.
Body Temperature – Body temperature fluctuates throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon and dropping at night.
Mental and Physical Performance – Alertness, reaction time, and muscle function tend to peak at different times of the day based on circadian rhythms.
Factors That Influence Circadian Rhythms:
Light Exposure: Natural light is the strongest regulator of circadian rhythms. Blue light from screens can delay sleep by suppressing melatonin production.
Meal Timing: Eating at irregular hours can disrupt circadian rhythms, affecting metabolism.
Shift Work & Travel: Night shifts or jet lag can misalign internal clocks, leading to sleep disorders and health issues.
Genetics: Some people are naturally “early birds” or “night owls” due to genetic differences in their circadian rhythms.
How to Maintain a Healthy Circadian Rhythm:
Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your internal clock.
Get Natural Sunlight Exposure: Especially in the morning, to reinforce your body's natural rhythms.
Limit Artificial Light at Night: Reduce screen time before bed to avoid disrupting melatonin production.
Eat Meals at Regular Times: Avoid eating too late at night to support metabolic health.
Exercise at the Right Times: Morning and afternoon exercise can support a strong circadian rhythm, while late-night workouts may delay sleep.
