ChatGPT said:
Chrono-Nutrition is an approach to eating that aligns food intake with the body's natural circadian rhythms to optimize metabolism, digestion, and overall health. It emphasizes when you eat as much as what you eat.

Core Principles of Chrono-Nutrition
Eat According to Your Biological Clock

The body has an internal clock (circadian rhythm) that regulates metabolism, hormone release, and digestion.
Eating in sync with these natural rhythms can improve weight management, digestion, and energy levels.
Front-Loading Calories

Eat heavier meals earlier in the day when metabolism is more active.
Reduce calorie intake in the evening when the body naturally slows down.
Meal Timing and Composition

Morning (Breakfast): High in proteins and healthy fats (e.g., eggs, nuts, cheese, whole grains).
Midday (Lunch): Balanced with proteins, carbs, and vegetables.
Afternoon (Snack): Light, preferably fruits or nuts.
Evening (Dinner): Light and low in carbs, focusing on proteins and vegetables.
Avoid Late-Night Eating

The body becomes less efficient at processing food in the evening, leading to fat storage and poor digestion.
Eating too late disrupts melatonin and insulin balance, affecting sleep and metabolism.
Respect the Fasting Window

Many chrono-nutrition plans align with intermittent fasting (IF) principles.
Example: 12:12 fasting window (e.g., eat between 8 AM - 8 PM and fast overnight).
Sync with Hormonal Rhythms

Cortisol (morning): Higher levels promote energy, so breakfast should be nutrient-dense.
Insulin Sensitivity (afternoon): Best time for carbohydrate consumption.
Melatonin (evening): Eating too late disrupts sleep and digestion.
