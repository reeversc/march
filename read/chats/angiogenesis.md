Both cardiovascular exercise and weight training for hypertrophy can stimulate angiogenesis, but the mechanisms and outcomes differ based on the type of exercise. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

Cardiovascular Exercise
Primary Mechanism: Cardiovascular exercise (e.g., running, cycling) creates sustained increases in blood flow, shear stress, and oxygen demand, which strongly stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. VEGF promotes angiogenesis by encouraging the growth of new capillaries to improve oxygen delivery to tissues.
Angiogenesis Outcome: Cardio tends to increase capillary density in skeletal muscles, particularly in endurance fibers (type I fibers). This adaptation improves oxygen delivery and waste removal, supporting prolonged aerobic activity.
Weight Training for Hypertrophy
Primary Mechanism: Resistance training induces transient increases in blood flow and muscle hypoxia during intense contractions, which also stimulates VEGF release. However, the stimulus is more localized to the working muscles.
Angiogenesis Outcome: Angiogenesis occurs but is often outpaced by the growth of muscle fibers. This can lead to a reduction in capillary-to-fiber ratio (relative capillary density) even if total capillary number increases.
Comparison
Cardiovascular Exercise: More effective at stimulating angiogenesis overall due to sustained, systemic increases in VEGF and capillary density. It's ideal for improving overall vascularization and endurance.
Weight Training for Hypertrophy: Induces angiogenesis as part of the repair and adaptation process but may not increase capillary density as effectively due to muscle fiber hypertrophy. However, it still supports localized angiogenesis in response to training stress.
Conclusion
If the goal is maximizing angiogenesis, cardiovascular exercise is generally more effective. For a combined approach, integrating cardiovascular exercise with hypertrophy-focused weight training can balance systemic and localized angiogenesis benefits.
