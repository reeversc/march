Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is regulated by a variety of genes involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and vessel stabilization. Key genes and their roles include:

Pro-Angiogenic Genes
VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) Family:

VEGFA: Stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and increases vascular permeability.
VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD: Involved in lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis.
FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) Family:

FGF2 (Basic FGF): Promotes endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation.
PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor):

PDGFB: Recruits pericytes and smooth muscle cells to stabilize blood vessels.
ANGPT (Angiopoietins):

ANGPT1: Binds to the Tie2 receptor to stabilize vessels and prevent leakage.
ANGPT2: Acts context-dependently as both an agonist and antagonist of Tie2, modulating vascular remodeling.
Ephrins and Eph Receptors:

EPHB4 and EFNB2: Regulate arterial and venous differentiation.
TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-Beta) Family:

TGFBR2 and SMADs: Mediate vessel maturation and stabilization.
MMPs (Matrix Metalloproteinases):

MMP2, MMP9: Degrade extracellular matrix to allow endothelial cell migration.
Anti-Angiogenic Genes
THBS (Thrombospondins):

THBS1 and THBS2: Inhibit endothelial cell migration and induce apoptosis.
TSPs (Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases):

TIMP1, TIMP2: Inhibit MMP activity, limiting extracellular matrix breakdown.
Angiogenesis Inhibitors:

Endostatin: Derived from collagen XVIII, inhibits endothelial proliferation.
TSP-1 (Thrombospondin-1): Blocks angiogenic signals.
Hypoxia-Induced Genes
HIF (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor):

HIF1A: Activates VEGF expression under hypoxic conditions.
EPO (Erythropoietin):

Promotes angiogenesis indirectly through red blood cell production and VEGF induction.
Signaling Pathway-Related Genes
NOTCH Pathway:

NOTCH1, DLL4: Regulate sprouting angiogenesis and tip/stalk cell differentiation.
PI3K/AKT Pathway:

Genes like PIK3CA and AKT1 are critical for endothelial survival and proliferation.
WNT Pathway:

WNT5A, FZD4: Involved in blood vessel development.
These genes coordinate angiogenesis under physiological conditions (e.g., wound healing) and pathological conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetic retinopathy).

Exercise-induced angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation in response to physical activity. This adaptation helps improve oxygen delivery, nutrient supply, and waste removal in response to increased metabolic demand. Exercise-induced angiogenesis is largely driven by mechanical stress, hypoxia, and metabolic changes, which activate specific signaling pathways and genes.

Key Genes Involved in Exercise-Induced Angiogenesis
1. Hypoxia-Responsive Genes
VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A):
Exercise increases oxygen demand, leading to localized hypoxia in muscles.
VEGFA expression is upregulated in response to hypoxia, promoting endothelial cell proliferation and vessel growth.
HIF1A (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha):
A master regulator of hypoxia-induced gene expression, including VEGFA.
2. Shear Stress-Responsive Genes
NOS3 (Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase):

Upregulated in response to increased blood flow and shear stress during exercise.
Produces nitric oxide (NO), which promotes vasodilation and enhances angiogenesis.
KLF2 (Kruppel-Like Factor 2):

A transcription factor induced by shear stress, regulating endothelial function and VEGFA expression.
3. Growth Factors and Receptors
FGF2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2):

Stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration.
Plays a role in both early and long-term angiogenesis during exercise adaptation.
PDGFB (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor B):

Recruits pericytes for vessel maturation and stabilization.
ANGPT1 (Angiopoietin-1):

Stabilizes newly formed blood vessels.
4. Extracellular Matrix Remodeling
MMP2 and MMP9 (Matrix Metalloproteinases):

Degrade the extracellular matrix, allowing endothelial cells to migrate and form new capillaries.
TIMP1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 1):

Regulates MMP activity to ensure controlled angiogenesis.
5. Inflammatory and Stress-Responsive Genes
IL6 (Interleukin-6):

Exercise-induced cytokine that modulates VEGFA expression and angiogenesis.
TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha):

At low levels, TNF-α promotes angiogenesis by upregulating VEGFA.
6. Metabolic Genes
PPARGC1A (PGC-1α, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha):

A key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis in response to exercise.
Activates VEGFA and endothelial nitric oxide production.
AMPK (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase):

Responds to increased energy demands during exercise.
Stimulates VEGFA expression and other pro-angiogenic factors.
7. NOTCH Signaling Pathway
NOTCH1 and DLL4 (Delta-Like Ligand 4):
Regulate the balance between tip and stalk endothelial cells during vessel sprouting.
Summary of Exercise-Induced Stimuli and Responses
Mechanical Stress:

Shear stress from increased blood flow induces nitric oxide and VEGFA production.
Hypoxia:

Localized hypoxia in active muscle triggers HIF1A and VEGFA expression.
Metabolic Demand:

Energy depletion activates PGC-1α and AMPK, leading to angiogenic signaling.
Inflammation:

Exercise-induced mild inflammation promotes the release of pro-angiogenic cytokines like IL-6.
Conclusion
Exercise-induced angiogenesis involves a complex interplay of genes and pathways driven by hypoxia, mechanical forces, and metabolic stress. The coordinated upregulation of VEGFA, NOS3, PGC-1α, and other related genes ensures the growth and stabilization of new blood vessels, improving tissue perfusion and endurance.
