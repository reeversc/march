i heard that a person only has so many fat cells.  i that then dont multiply, they just change in size

You're mostly right, but there's a bit more nuance to it.

How Fat Cells Work:
Fat Cells (Adipocytes) Change in Size – The number of fat cells in your body is largely set during childhood and adolescence. When you gain or lose weight, these fat cells shrink or expand as they store or release fat.

Fat Cell Number Can Increase, But Rarely Decrease – While most fat cells don’t multiply in adulthood, they can still increase in extreme weight gain situations (such as severe obesity). However, once they are created, they don’t go away—even with weight loss.

Fat Cells Don’t Disappear With Weight Loss – When you lose weight, the fat inside the cells is used for energy, and the cells shrink, but they remain in your body, making it easier to regain weight.

Some Exceptions Exist – Certain conditions (like extreme weight gain or pregnancy) may lead to the creation of new fat cells. However, significant fat cell reduction only happens through procedures like liposuction or extreme medical interventions.

So, while fat cells primarily change in size, they can still multiply in certain conditions—but they rarely decrease in number naturally.

so on a cellular level, what i occuring when a fat cell increases in size?  and how did food make that happen?
ChatGPT said:
When a fat cell increases in size, it's because it's storing excess energy from the food you eat. Let's break it down at the cellular level and connect it to food intake.

Step 1: Digestion and Absorption of Nutrients
When you eat food, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are broken down in the digestive system.
Carbohydrates are broken into glucose, which enters the bloodstream.
Fats are broken into fatty acids and glycerol and absorbed into the bloodstream.
Proteins are broken into amino acids, which mostly go toward building and repairing tissues, but can be converted into energy if needed.
Step 2: Energy Usage or Storage Decision
After a meal, insulin (a hormone from the pancreas) is released in response to rising blood glucose levels.
Insulin signals cells to take up glucose for energy.
If the body doesn't need all the energy immediately, it has to store it somewhere.
Step 3: Storage in Fat Cells (Adipocytes)
A. Storing Excess Carbohydrates as Fat
If glucose isn’t burned for energy, the liver converts excess glucose into triglycerides (fat molecules).
These triglycerides are then transported in the blood and absorbed by fat cells.
The fat cells store the triglycerides in lipid droplets, causing the fat cell to expand.
B. Storing Dietary Fat Directly
The fat you eat (fatty acids and glycerol) gets packaged into chylomicrons (fat transport particles).
These circulate in the blood and are taken up directly by fat cells.
Inside the fat cells, they get reassembled into triglycerides and stored.
Step 4: Fat Cell Expansion
As more triglycerides are stored inside the lipid droplet of the fat cell, the cell swells.
The lipid droplet takes up more space inside the fat cell, making it larger.
Over time, if too much fat is stored, the fat cells can become very large.
Step 5: If Fat Cells Reach Their Limit
If an individual keeps consuming excess calories beyond what existing fat cells can store, the body may trigger hyperplasia, meaning it creates new fat cells to accommodate more storage.
In Summary:
You eat food → Nutrients are digested and enter the bloodstream.
Excess energy (glucose & fats) gets converted into triglycerides.
Triglycerides are stored inside fat cells, making them expand.
If fat cells get too full, the body may create new fat cells.
So, when people gain weight, their fat cells are mostly getting larger, but in extreme cases, the body may make new fat cells to store even more energy.
