The essential padding within your knee, known as knee cartilage, comes in two varieties: articular and meniscus. Their purpose is to shield the bones and provide a cushioning effect that enables effortless movement of the joints while warding off bone fractures. Their self-repair capabilities are quite limited once they sustain damage. This may result in significant problems such as heightened joint pressure, formation of bone spurs, or complications with subchondral bone giving rise to cysts and lesions.

It's evident that preserving healthy cartilage is paramount for sustaining our health and ensuring mobility. Cartilage cells play a crucial role in maintaining the health and integrity of knee cartilage by regulating inflammatory pathways and promoting the growth and repair of these vital tissues.

### The Role of Cartilage in Knee Health

Emphasizing the significance of cartilage in preserving knee health is critical. Cartilage within the knee serves multiple functions, including:

- Acting as a cushion for joints
- Ensuring bones do not grind against each other
- Facilitating fluid joint movement
- Offering defense against bone fractures

Articular cartilage, which is one variety of joint cartilage, cloaks the ends of bones to create a slick surface that enables easy movement within the joint.

There is meniscus cartilage—this resilient and flexible tissue evenly spreads body weight throughout the knee. These essential roles underscore just how vital it is to keep our cartilaginous structures healthy.

### Causes of Cartilage Damage

The primary factor contributing to cartilage damage is often osteoarthritis. This condition involves the wearing away and breakdown of articular cartilage, significant joint inflammation, as well as alterations in the tissue of the subchondral bone. Enzymes that break down matrix components are stimulated by cytokines like IL-1 and TNF-alpha, leading to a deterioration of cartilage structure and resulting in joint inflammation.

Damage can also occur acutely in knee cartilage due to sports injuries or overuse. Carrying excess body weight puts more strain on knee joints, which exacerbates wear on the cartilage during activities that involve bearing weight. To mitigate harm to one's cartilage it's essential not only to keep a healthy weight but also steer clear of injuries whenever possible.
