genes are molecules?
ChatGPT said:
Genes are not molecules themselves; rather, they are segments of DNA, which is a molecule. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a large, complex molecule made up of smaller molecular subunits called nucleotides. Each gene is a specific sequence of these nucleotides that contains the instructions for making proteins or regulating biological processes.

So, while genes are part of the DNA molecule, they are better described as units of hereditary information, not individual molecules.







You said:
so dna are molecules?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule. Specifically, it is a macromolecule, meaning it is a large and complex molecule. DNA consists of smaller molecular subunits called nucleotides, which are made up of:

A sugar molecule (deoxyribose)
A phosphate group
A nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine)
These nucleotides are linked together in a long chain, forming the well-known double-helix structure. DNA is classified as a type of nucleic acid, one of the key biomolecules essential to life.
