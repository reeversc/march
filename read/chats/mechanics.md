Ejaculation is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, smooth and skeletal muscles, and the reproductive tract. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the biomechanics:

1. Phases of Ejaculation
Ejaculation occurs in two primary phases:

A. Emission Phase
Location: Primarily involves the seminal vesicles, prostate, vas deferens, and epididymis.
Nervous Control: Sympathetic nervous system.
Process:
Spermatozoa are propelled from the epididymis through the vas deferens by peristaltic contractions.
Secretions from the seminal vesicles and prostate mix with sperm to form semen.
The internal urethral sphincter (located at the bladder neck) contracts to prevent retrograde ejaculation into the bladder.
B. Expulsion Phase
Location: Urethra and surrounding musculature.
Nervous Control: Primarily the somatic nervous system via the pudendal nerve, and some contribution from the autonomic nervous system.
Process:
Rhythmic contractions of the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles occur.
These contractions generate pressure within the urethra, propelling semen out through the penile meatus.
Pelvic floor muscles and the muscles of the perineum also contribute to this forceful expulsion.
2. Muscle Dynamics
Smooth Muscles:
Present in the walls of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles.
Their coordinated contractions ensure the forward movement of semen components.
Striated Muscles:
The bulbospongiosus muscle is the primary driver of expulsion.
It contracts in bursts, synchronized with urethral pressure changes, to push semen out forcefully.
3. Urethral Pressure Dynamics
High intraluminal pressure within the urethra is critical for expulsion.
This pressure is generated by muscular contractions and the force of the ejaculate traveling through the constricted urethra.
4. Nervous System Involvement
Parasympathetic Nervous System:
Stimulates arousal and erection, setting the stage for ejaculation.
Sympathetic Nervous System:
Dominates during the emission phase, triggering seminal fluid movement and urethral sphincter closure.
Somatic Nervous System:
Controls the striated muscle contractions during the expulsion phase.
5. Energy Transfer
The rapid contractions of muscles and peristaltic movements in the reproductive ducts require significant ATP energy, which is supported by mitochondria in muscle cells.
6. Reflex Pathways
Ejaculation is controlled by a spinal reflex:

Sensory input from the penis triggers spinal cord centers in the lumbar and sacral regions.
This reflex integrates sensory and autonomic responses to ensure proper timing and coordination of the two phases.
Understanding these biomechanics can also help diagnose and treat ejaculatory dysfunctions such as premature ejaculation or anejaculation.
