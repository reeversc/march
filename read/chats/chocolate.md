is there magnesium in dark chocolate?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, dark chocolate contains magnesium. In fact, it's considered a good source of magnesium. The amount varies depending on the cocoa content, but generally, the darker the chocolate (with higher cocoa content), the more magnesium it contains. For example, a 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of dark chocolate (70-85% cocoa) can provide around 60-70 mg of magnesium, which is about 15-18% of the recommended daily intake for adults.

in what form?
ChatGPT said:
The magnesium in dark chocolate typically occurs in its natural mineral form, bound within the cocoa solids. Cocoa beans are rich in magnesium due to the mineral content of the soil in which they're grown.

In terms of its chemical state, magnesium in dark chocolate is usually present as magnesium salts, such as magnesium oxide or magnesium citrate, depending on the natural composition of the cocoa. These forms are bioavailable, meaning the body can absorb and use them effectively, though the exact bioavailability depends on individual digestion and the presence of other compounds in the chocolate.
